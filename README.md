# 75 Days Done 🏆 Completed the Generative AI & LLM Learning Challenge!

I'm thrilled to announce that I've officially completed the 75-day Generative AI & LLM learning challenge! It's been an incredible journey of exploration, experimentation, and pushing my understanding of these fascinating technologies.

In addition to the learning, I documented my progress by creating videos and sharing them on various platforms. I also actively discussed my learnings through LinkedIn posts.

📚 All Days Consolidated Sheet [Day 1 to Day 75] - https://bit.ly/3wpO044 🚀

💻 Here are 5 key takeaways from the challenge:
1. Generative AI is just combination of creative thinking and making system generalize on them.
2. LLMs are transformer based models, so if your fundamentals of transformers are done! LLMs are piece of cake for you.
3. Fine Tuning or LLM Traning is as simple as ML Model Traning, just need proper framework for each type of data (Text, Audio, Video or Images).
4. Building or Maintaining High Precision LLM at your local system is quite expensive so Quantization is best here to reduce the Size of LLM.
5. LLM Evaluation is crucial thing, if your LLM does not get validated for all the metrics of langauge model evaluation, it might create chaos among users.
